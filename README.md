# Fractal Design Patterns: Mandelbrot & Julia Sets

Welcome to the **Fractal Design Patterns: Mandelbrot & Julia Sets** repository, a specialized collection dedicated to the exploration and generation of two of the most fascinating fractals in mathematics and art. This project dives deep into the Mandelbrot and Julia sets, showcasing the beauty and complexity inherent in these patterns. Here, enthusiasts and developers alike will find tools and algorithms designed to explore these fractals in unprecedented detail.

## Features

- **Mandelbrot Set Exploration:** Dive into the infinite complexity of the Mandelbrot set with tools that allow for deep zooming and high-resolution rendering.
- **Julia Set Generation:** Explore the Julia set's diverse beauty, generating patterns based on different parameters for a wide array of visual experiences.
- **Customization Options:** Tweak parameters such as zoom level, iteration count, and color schemes to create unique visual representations of these fractal sets.

## How to Use

Begin your journey into the heart of fractal geometry by:

1. Cloning the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigating to the project directory.
3. Installing the required dependencies.
4. Running the main script to simply visualise the fractal sets.
5. Selecting either the Mandelbrot or Julia set and adjusting parameters to generate the fractal.
